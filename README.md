# Design-of-Experiments-tools-set

Repository of statistical tools for Design of Experiments

Important part of this repository is based in the python package pyDOE, according to the official webpage, this package is designed for its use for scientist, engineers, statistician to support optimal experimental designs. The Capabilities includes:

 1) Factorial Designs.
    1.1) General Full Factorial.
    1.2) 2-Level Full Factorial.
    1.3) 2-Level Fractional-Factorial.
    1.4) Plackett-Burman
    
 2) Response-Surface Design.
    2.2) Box-Behnkel
    3.2) Central-Composite
    
 3) Randomized Designs.
    3.1) Latin-Hypercube

The functionalities requires the use of the packages:

 1) NumPy a well known fundamental package for scientific computing.
 2) SciPy consisting of a set of fundamental algoritms for scientific computing in Python.

All the available functionalities can be accessed by the statement

 >> from pyDOE import *
