# Introduction

When comes to make a first view to the data of the problem we want to solve using Experimental Design approach, then it is very useful to start with a basic statistical tool that allow us to do a first assesment of the measurements. Here is a set of key descriptive statistics tools that includes:

## Measures of Central Tendency:

 - Mean (Average): Determines the central tendency of the data.
 - Median: Useful for skewed data to understand the central position without the influence of outliers.
 - Mode

## Measures of Dispersion:

 - Standard Deviation (SD): Measures the dispersion or variability around the mean.
 - Variance: The square of the standard deviation, indicating data spread.
 - Range (Maximum - Minimum): Shows the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
 - Interquartile Range (IQR)

## Additional Statistics:

 - Count (number of observations) or size of the sample
 - Sum
