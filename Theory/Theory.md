# Experimental Design

## Strategy of Experimentation

- "Best-guess" experiment
  - Used very often
  - More succesful than could be expected, but with lot of disadventages
- One-fator-at-a-time (OFAT) experiments
  - Sometimes associated with the "scientific" or "engineering" method
  - Devastated by interaction, also very inefficient
- Statistically designed experiments
  - Based on FisherÂ´s factorial concept

## 7 Step approach

1) Recognition of the statements of the problems
2) Choice of factors, leveles, and ranges
3) Selection of the response variables
4) Choice of design
5) Conducting the experiments
6) Statistical analysis
7) Drawing conclusions, recommendations.

## Planning, Conducting and Analyzing an Experiment

 - Get statistical thinking involved early
 - Your non-statistical knowledge is crucial to success
 - Pre-experimental planning (step 1-3) vital
 - Think and experiment sequentially (used the KISS principle)
 - See Colemand and Montgomery (1993) Technometrics paper + supplemental text material
 
### Factorial Design
 In factorial experimental design, all possible combinations of factor levels are tested.
