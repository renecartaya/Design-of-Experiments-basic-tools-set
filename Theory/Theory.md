# Experimental Design

## Strategy of Experimentation

- "Best-guess" experiment
  - Used very often
  - More succesful than could be expected, but with lot of disadventages
- One-fator-at-a-time (OFAT) experiments
  - Sometimes associated with the "scientific" or "engineering" method
  - Devastated by interaction, also very inefficient
- Statistically designed experiments
  - Based on FisherÂ´s factorial concept
