# Experimental Design

Design of Experiments as is known today was structured by Fisher under three basic concepts that form its basis:

 - Randonization: running the test of an experiment in randon order.
 - Replication: repeating at leas some runs of the experiment
 - Blocking: a technique to control nuisance variation during the experiment

Alongside with this three basic concepts, Fisher create the basic idea of Factorial Design as well as the idea of Analysis of Variance

## Strategy of Experimentation

- "Best-guess" experiment
  - Used very often
  - More succesful than could be expected, but with lot of disadventages
- One-fator-at-a-time (OFAT) experiments
  - Sometimes associated with the "scientific" or "engineering" method
  - Devastated by interaction, also very inefficient
- Statistically designed experiments
  - Based on FisherÂ´s factorial concept

## 7 Step process

Well defined process steps to help to carry out a successful design experiment

1) Recognition of the statements of the problems
2) Choice of factors, leveles, and ranges
3) Selection of the response variables
4) Choice of design
5) Conducting the experiments
6) Statistical analysis
7) Drawing conclusions, recommendations.

## 3 Step report principle
1) Describe the problem: concise statemen of the problem that the experiment addresses
2) Identify the factor to be studied in the experiment: ranges of factors and numbers of levels
3) Identify the response variable or variables: this including how response is going to be measured and how the measuring technique is calibrated and how the measurement system ramains consistent or in calibration during the experiment.

## Planning, Conducting and Analyzing an Experiment

 - Get statistical thinking involved early
 - Your non-statistical knowledge is crucial to success
 - Pre-experimental planning (step 1-3) vital
 - Think and experiment sequentially (used the KISS principle)
 - See Colemand and Montgomery (1993) Technometrics paper + supplemental text material
 
### Factorial Design
 In factorial experimental design, all possible combinations of factor levels are tested.

 ### Note

 In the creation of current experimental design,Fisher created:

## Basic statistical concepts

Some important concepts for the description of the sample data

 - Random samples
 - Sample mean
 - Sample variance
 - Sample stanard deviation
 - Population versus sampling
 - Population mean
 - Population variance
 - Population satandard deviation
 - Estimating parametres

Simple comparative experiments tools could include:

 - The hypothesis testing framework
 - The two-sample t-test
 - Checking assumptions, validity

### The Hypothesis Testing Framework

Statistical hypothesis testing is a useful framework for many experimental solutions. This framework includes:

 - Two-sample t-test: sampling for a normal distribution and use the statistical Hyphotesis:
